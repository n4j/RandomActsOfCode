# RandomActsOfCode
This repository contains some random code written by me either to test drive a new framework or do some experimental coding stuff like wouldn't it be cool to write a tool which starts Chrome in Private mode when someone presses Ctrl + Shift + N ? 

Each directory is a top-level project in itself and it would generally contain a README file describing the project and some input files if its releveant to the project. 

I mostly code in Java but there might be some projects in Node.js, Golang, C/C++ too.
